# love2D-Example-Game
Very similar to my "love2D-Sandbox-Project" repo, this repo aims to research how to create a side-scrolling, efficient and simple platformer using the LOVE2D framework, of which uses the Lua language, got any suggestions for coding (optimisations, changes, etc)? Than don't be afraid to tell me! I'm always trying to improve my coding skills :)
